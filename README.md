# FinalProjectCIS152
This is my final project submission for CIS 152 - Data Structures.

For my project, I have decided to use an ArrayList and a HashMap. I chose to use a HashMap to store the paints using the brand
as the key, and the paint color as the value. This makes searching them for removal easy and efficient. Furthermore, an ArrayList provides my application the ability to store more than one value to each key.
